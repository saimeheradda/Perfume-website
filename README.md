I completed my Full Stack Developer Internship Task for Olcademy, developing a full-stack application with a responsive frontend and robust backend. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend and Node.js for backend functionalities, managing product data and enhancing user experience with appealing layouts and styles.
